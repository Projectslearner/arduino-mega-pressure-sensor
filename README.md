# Pressure Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Pressure Sensor project demonstrates how to read analog values from a pressure sensor using an Arduino Mega. Pressure sensors are used to measure force applied per unit area, which converts into electrical signals proportional to the applied pressure.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **Pressure Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Pressure Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **pressureSensorPin**: Analog pin connected to the pressure sensor (e.g., A0).
   - **VCC**: Connect to 5V on Arduino Mega.
   - **GND**: Connect to GND on Arduino Mega.
   - **Signal Out**: Connect to the analog pin (pressureSensorPin).

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the pressure sensor to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Library or Dependencies:**
   - No additional libraries are required for basic analog input reading.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

4. **Testing:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud) to monitor the pressure sensor values.
   - Observe the analog values and corresponding voltage readings that represent the pressure applied.

#### Applications

- **Pressure Measurement:** Used in various applications such as industrial automation, weather stations, and medical equipment.
- **Force Sensing:** Provides feedback on force or pressure exerted on surfaces or objects.

#### Notes

- Ensure the pressure sensor is calibrated and provides accurate readings for specific applications.
- Consider using additional components like amplifiers or conditioning circuits for precise measurement requirements.
- Adjust the code or scaling factors to accommodate different pressure sensor specifications or output ranges.
